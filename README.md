This vim script will allow you to make a function call to tidy 
the script in the buffer according to the respective filetype.

This is the very early stage of the script (about 3 hours).
I am only concentrating on PHP at the moment then things such as 
SQL; JS; jQuery; HTML; CSS and any other ones that I'm familiar with.

I'm putting it on here as it's good practice for me to keep up with 
tags and git etc.

Obviously any critiques regarding how I can make my code simpler and 
more efficient are welcome. I for one am not after wringing every 
milli-second out of my code, instead I like to make sure that it's 
written well and according to conventions.

Also I have no experience of certain languages (C etc) and so I would 
look for help in that department if needed but that is a long way 
down the line as I will concentrate on the langauges that I know
and use first.

Thanks in advance and if you have any queries or suggestions then
please contact me and please.......be gentle

John
